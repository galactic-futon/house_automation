Welcome to House Automation!

The purpose of these functions is to automate all of my web browsing, because I'm just that lazy

specifically, I would like to automate my browsing of dynamic web pages - static DOM's are easier on the eyes, so I
figure I'll build a robot to sift through all that yucky javascript. Unfortunately, many dynamic websites don't like
that very much, so I have to be careful, and others ought to use these tools at their own risk.

Enjoy.
